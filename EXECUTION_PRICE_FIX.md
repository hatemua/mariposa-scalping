# Execution Price Fix

## Problem
```
Invalid quantity calculated for SOLUSDT: 0
```

**Root Cause**: Whale activity signals don't have `takeProfitPrice` or `recommendedEntry` set, so the executor was using `price = 0`, resulting in `quantity = positionSize / 0 = 0`.

## Solution

**File**: `src/services/validatedSignalExecutor.ts`

**Changes**:
1. Added `binanceService` import to fetch real-time market prices
2. Enhanced price resolution logic:
   - Try `validatedSignal.takeProfitPrice` first
   - Fallback to `validatedSignal.recommendedEntry`
   - **If both missing → fetch current market price from Binance**
3. Added detailed logging for debugging

**Code Flow**:
```typescript
// 1. Try to get price from validated signal
let executionPrice = validatedSignal.takeProfitPrice || validatedSignal.recommendedEntry;

// 2. If no price, fetch from Binance (REAL-TIME)
if (!executionPrice || executionPrice <= 0) {
  const marketData = await binanceService.getSymbolInfo(symbol);
  executionPrice = parseFloat(marketData.lastPrice || marketData.price);
}

// 3. Calculate quantity
const quantity = executionPrice > 0 ? positionSize / executionPrice : 0;

// 4. Validate before execution
if (quantity <= 0 || executionPrice <= 0) {
  console.error(`Invalid: quantity=${quantity}, price=${executionPrice}, positionSize=${positionSize}`);
  return;
}
```

## Expected Logs (After Fix)

### Success Case:
```
📤 Processing 1 validated signals from queue
🎯 Executing signal whale_123 for agent abc (SOLUSDT BUY)
⚠️  No price in signal, fetching current market price for SOLUSDT...
✅ Fetched current market price for SOLUSDT: 142.35
💰 Trade calculation: 50 USDT / 142.35 = 0.351234 SOLUSDT
✅ Trade scheduled: BUY 0.351234 SOLUSDT @ $142.35 (50 USDT)
📝 Updated agent signal log for whale_123
✅ Processed 1 validated signals
```

### Why This Happens:
- **Opportunity signals**: Usually have `targetPrice` set by LLM analysis
- **Whale activity signals**: Often don't have target price (just detect large orders)
- **Solution**: Fetch current market price as fallback (REAL DATA from Binance)

## Verification

After restart, you should see:
1. No more "Invalid quantity calculated" errors
2. Successful trade scheduling with actual prices
3. Logs showing fetched market prices when needed

The executor now handles **all signal types** correctly by always ensuring a valid execution price!
